                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">Below are some interesting facts about bees and honey.

                    Find out more about bees and pollination.
                    
                    All worker bees are female.
                    A bee produces a teaspoon of honey (about 5 grams) in her lifetime.
                    To produce a kilogram of honey, bees fly the equivalent of three times around the world in air miles.
                    The type of flower the bees take their nectar from determines the honey’s flavour.
                    Male bees (drones) have bigger eyes to help them find the Queen Bee.
                    Bees mate high in the sky. Afterwards the male bee loses his reproductive organs and dies.
                    A Queen Bee can produce 2,000 eggs a day. Fertilised eggs become females and unfertilised eggs become males, with the help of pheromones.
                    To get more bees in your garden grow more colour.
                    Bees love blue and love cluster plants like lavender and rosemary.
                    Bees don't want to sting you because they die.
                    There are over 20,000 different species of bee, found on every continent except Antarctica.
                    Honey has been shown to have many health benefits both when eaten and when applied to the skin. The darker the honey the better.
                    The bee is the only social insect to be partially domesticated by humans.</p>

              <h3>FROG</h3>

            <div style="display: flex;">
                <img src="images/frog.jpg" alt="Example Image" style="width: 300px;">
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">In general, frogs have protruding eyes, no tail, and strong, webbed hind feet that are adapted for leaping and swimming. They also possess smooth, moist skins. Many are predominantly aquatic, but some live on land, in burrows, or in trees. Harlequin frogs, which are also known as variegated toads (Atelopus), are found in South and Central America. They are commonly triangular-headed and have enlarged hind feet. Some are brightly coloured in black with yellow, red, or green. When molested, the small poisonous Melanophryniscus stelzneri of Uruguay bends its head and limbs over its body to display its bright orange hands and feet. This position may be a method of warning the intruder of the toxicity of the toad. </p>

              <h3>LADYBIRD</h3>

              <div style="display: flex;">
                <img src="images/ladybird.jpg" alt="Example Image" style="width: 300px;">
                <p style="margin-left: 80px;">There are about 5,000 different species of ladybirds in the world. These much loved critters are also known as lady beetles or ladybugs, and in many cultures they’re considered good luck. They come in many different colours and patterns, but the most familiar in the UK is the seven-spot ladybird, which has a shiny, red-and-black body. Most people like ladybirds because they are pretty, graceful and harmless to humans. But farmers love them because they eat aphids and other plant-eating pests. And boy do they eat in it’s year-long life, a single seven-spot ladybird can gobble more than 5000 aphids!
